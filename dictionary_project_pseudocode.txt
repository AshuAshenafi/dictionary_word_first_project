/*
*This program receives ten words from the user and prints 
* 1. according to the insertion order
* 2. alphabetical order
* 3. reverse alphabetical order
* 4. it also prints words that start with vowels
*/

1. start

2. create an array with the five vowels all in small letter, arrays, variables

3. Prompt user to enter ten words

4. loop, scan and save the 10 words in the first array 

// ALPHABETICAL ORDER
*******************************************
4. copy the array to the second array (for the first array to preserve insertion order)

//use bubble sort algorith to sort
5. (use second array) get the first index array value and the second next index array value

6. compare and if the second value is alphabeticaly prior to the first then swap

// so the value in the prime index is alphabeticaly prior 

7. move the index one step in line 5 ( that is the first index) and finish the loop until the last index

//REVERSE ALPHABETICAL ORDER
********************************************
8. copy the second array (which is already in ascending order) to third copy to start the reversing

9. (use third array) index shall start from one value lesser than array length and another index value 
(like variable num) shall start from zero

10. The last index value of the third array is assigned to the zero index value of the second array.
The first index goes decreasing to zero while the second index go increasing from zero and 
second array values are assigned accordingly.

//WORDS THAT START WITH VOWEL
11. (use the second array or which is already sorted)
     Assign the first index array value to temporary variable

12. change the temporary string variable in line 11 into lower case

13. get the first character of the temp string and compare it with all the values of vowel array

14. if the string starts with the vowel get the array value into the fourth new array

//display
15. display original array with insertion order

16. display the second array with alphabetical order

17. display the third array with reverse alphabetical order

18. display the fourth array with words that start with vowels
